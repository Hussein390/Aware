    description: `A) Personal life:

Sayed Kamal al-Haydari was born in the holy city of Karbala in 1957. He developed interest for religious studies during his teenage while pursuing his mainstream education and started attending various classes of prominent scholars on Jurisprudence (Fiqh) and principals of Jurisprudence (Usul). He was involved in various socio-political activities which led to his arrest by the Ba’ath regime and finally he was forced to leave his hometown and settle in the holy city of Qom, Iran. Ayatollah Haydari’s three brothers were martyred by the Ba’ath regime.

Serving Ahul Bayt’s school of thought academically is a divine blessing and honor attained by a few scholars. This mission is achieved through proximity to the holy verses and narrations and by spending an entire lifetime in contemplating over them with utmost determination in studying and learning various Islamic sciences and values including Tafsir, Hadith, jurisprudence, Usul, mysticism, philosophy, theology and ethics.

B) Education and teachers:

Sayed Kamal al-Haydari began his education in Karbala and later Najaf under some of the most renowned scholars, Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr, Sayed Abul Qasim Khoei, Mirza Ali Gharavi and Sayed Nasrullah Mustanbit being the most prominent of them. He was so influenced by the scientific methods and persona of Shaheed Sadr amongst all of them that he was appointed as Sadr’s representative in Karbala. Shaheed Sadr’s strong influence on Ayatollah Haydari can be visibly seen in his books and works.

After moving to Qom, he studied Tafsir, philosophy and mysticism under Ayatollah Jawadi Amoli and Allama Hassanzade Amoli and Fiqh and Usul under Ayatollah Mirza Jawad Tabrizi and Ayatollah Shaykh Hossein Vahid Khorasani. Now, he himself teaches Darse Kharij (Higher stage) in the subjects of Fiqh, Usul, philosophy, mysticism, Tafsir and theology from a few years after successfully teaching many Sat’h courses (Lower stage). Owing to the Arabic medium of his classes, he has been able to impart a lot of the profound knowledge present in the Shi’a seminaries especially the Qom seminary, particularly works of Imam Khomeini and Allama Tabatabaei to the Arab world. Because of huge public reception to his classes, he has recently started to instruct courses in Persian as well.

C) His methodology in religious studies:

Holism in Islamic sciences:

One of the most important characteristics of Ayatollah Haydari’s approach to religious studies is his holism and application of various religious sciences. A religious scholar is holistic only if he has knowledge of all the dimensions of the religion’s teachings. This does not mean that a mere basic knowledge is enough, instead he ought to have a deep understanding of them and have Ijtihad in them. And if possible, be a theorist in all fields. Simply speaking, a complete and holistic scholar must be an expert in all three fields of theology, ethics and jurisprudence.

Introducing new ideas and theories:

Sayed Kamal al-Haydari introduces new concepts, methods, approaches and principles in various Islamic sciences which are thought provoking, and sometimes against the popular belief of the scholars. Those who read his books or listen to his lectures, will definitely be exposed to new horizons and matters in various fields of knowledge.

A strong hold over contemporary thought and theories:

Sayed Kamal al-Haydari has a strong hold over the influential contemporary ideas and theories which he has acquired by deeply studying the works and views of both, Shia and Sunni Muslim scholars. He is one of the few scholars who have a good grasp over important ideas and thoughts present in Iran and the Arab world as well as non-Muslim thinkers.

Free thought and courage

Another feature of Sayed Kamal al-Haydari’s research in religious sciences is his intellectual independence and freedom of thought regarding basic religious beliefs and an active and non-abiding approach to others’ opinions. According to him, the consensus of the scholars, popular belief and postulates have no credibility. Logic and proof is the only criterion he accepts in intellectual discussions. He, at times questions and contemplates on various principles and foundations that have been accepted by religious scholars without questioning for ages. When some of these ideas are looked at critically, it becomes clear that they are not supported by strong logic and scientific proof and thus need a re-evaluation.

A strong faith on the comprehensiveness and interdependence of Islamic sciences:

Fifth characteristic of Sayed Kamal al-Haydari’s religious thought and the foundation of the first characteristic is his strong faith on a strong relationship between different Islamic sciences.

He believes that separation of Islamic sciences is possible only for the sake of studying and teaching them, otherwise limiting oneself to only one subject is meaningless when solving an issue related to jurisprudence or beliefs and will result in tremendous mistakes and contradictions. If we see different subjects are taught separately in universities and seminaries, some study jurisprudence, some theology and some philosophy, it is because there is no other option but to separate them and to learn each of them in a particular time and conditions, academically. This, although has led to the incorrect idea that it is possible to learn Islamic sciences independent from each other.

According to the said approach, he apart from teaching various subjects, by the grace of God, has had tremendous success in writing books too. Sayed Kamal al-Haydari has published more than 130 works in the fields of Fiqh, Usul, Tafsir, Hadith, theology, philosophy, mysticism, ethics, logic and epistemology, etc. Most of his works are in Arabic and some of them have been translated to Persian. Around 20 other books have been translated to Persian and will be published gradually, Insha Allah.`

      description: `Ali Al-Wardi (1913-1995) was an Iraqi prominent sociologist, and a theorist who was credited for founding the first Iraqi, and Arab, modern sociology school in the mid-20th century. Al-Wardi’s works theorised the psychological, cultural, and material distances between city and country, arguing that this gap hindered the creation of a national collective identity, and thus, needed a continuous governmental intervention. Al-Wardi adapted the works of the classic Arabic philosopher Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) who dichotomised Islamic societies into two main irrevocable spaces; Bedawa/ rural, and Hadara/ urban. Applying this Khalduni social theory to the Iraqi context, Al-Wardi concluded that the Bedouin amalgamation with the urban societies fostered a dual Iraqi personality that fluctuated between the bedouin/tribal values, and modern traditions of the metropolis. Al-Wardi termed this social episode as The Ebb and Flow phenomenon ظاهرة المد والجزر in his book A study in the Nature of the Iraqi Society (1965). While the wane/ ebb of Bedouin principles, as Al-Wardin suggested, takes place when the state is strong enough to exercise its power and sovereignty, the rise/ flow of these values dominate once the state becomes weak, and decentralised. Despite the fact that Al-Wardi was not a political scientist, his works about Iraqi society have been recurrently visited by foreign policy makers, and political pundits  to understand the reasons behind Iraq’s slow steps in establishing a democratic state post 2003. His works were regularly referenced to analyse the failure of the American occupation to manage, or even to understand, Iraqi social structures, and fabrics in the countryside. Hence going back to Al-Wardi’s social theory will offer a new analytical lens to help in understanding the Iraqi political crisis today.

Intellectual Context:

Al-Wardi’s intellectual formation was a product of the post WWI  public intellectual era. The interwar period signified the shift of socio-political philosophy and epistemology from universalism to nationalism, and domestic state-nation relations. Edward Said identified the public intellectuals as a social group who “write[s] to, as well as for, the public”. The social role of public intellectual expanded from challenging the previously accepted conventions and dogmas, to critiquing the society through enhancing critical thinking to reach socio political reforms. Centralising the role of the public intellectual spoke to the ethos of autonomy, and nationalism dominated the Iraqi, and Arab, public sphere in a time that was witnessing the demise of colonialism, and the rise of independence. Hence, the dialectical debates about colonial and anticolonial political movements, both communism and nationalism, and the state-building process under modernisation, and urbanisation shaped the national consciousness of the state-nation relation.

Iraqi tribalism occupied a significant space in the state-nation building process, and intellectual debate, when the first modern Iraqi state was installed by the British mandate in 1920. Since the early 20th century, the spatial ontology of the Iraqi nation was constituted by popularising the narrative of the polarity of urbanists and non-urbanists, tribe members and sheikhs, peasants, or ma'dan (marsh dwellers). While the British mandate considered the tribal sheikhs as administrative apparatus to control the rural areas, Iraqi intellectuals looked at them as symbols of the nation’s backwardness and a power against modernity and reform.  It is important to emphasise here that the centrality of understanding this urban-rural discourse has set the knowledge production about Iraqi society even by Iraqis themselves. As a public intellectual, not a partisan, Al-Wardi’s input to these dialectical conversations about constitutionalism, democracy and individualism underpinned his interest in the psychoanalysis of the Iraqi identity vis-à-vis the nature of the Hadara- Badawa conflict. Al-Wardi believed that this spatio-cultural contestation shaped the dynamics of the modern Iraqi state, and collective identity of the Iraqi nation.

Another factor that influenced Al-Wardi’s interest in investigating the urban-rural power conflict was his postgraduate studies (M.A. and PhD) at The University of Texas (1945-1950). The post-war intellectual climate in Texas  incubated populist intellectualism driven by human rights movements, including those of Black and Hispanic communities. Several intellectual conversations gathered Al-Wardi, Walter Firey, and Carl Martin Rosenquist about the importance to historicise religious and racial structures in urban cities to understand the modern nature of dualism. These conversational relations continued after Al-Wardi’s return to Iraq in 1950.

Main Argument:

The core of Al-Wardi’s social theory can be traced in his works; A Study into the Nature of Iraqi Society (1965), and Social Glimpses from Iraqi Modern History (1968-1976). In both seminal works, Al-Wardi argues that Iraqi personality suffers from izdiwajiyah/ disharmony for embodying urban and Bedouin characteristics. This izdiwajiyah was created due to peasants' transitional position from the deserts, and from being Bedouins, to the socio-economic context of urban spaces. Al-Wardi sees that these relocated communities struggle to adapt to the codes and principles of urbanism, preferring to keep their affinity asabiyah to their tribe, later on to their sect, rather than abiding by the city laws. The tribal and nomadic values have restructured the Iraqi urban society by introducing clanic codes of behaviour, morals, and rules of conduct to the sedentary city centres.  Nomadic values are instigated from the cruel environment of the desert that forces the ethos of asabiyah to the tribe, the spirit of adherence, and abidance to the Sheikhs who represent the traditional authority in the tribal community. The tribal principles are static, unchangeable which enforces the pride of the tribal identity as age old, thus, asabiyah to the tribe is the practical continuum of badawa. On the other hand, urban societies are the centre of statism, modernity and law where the loyalty of urbanites is for the state. Since the city is the centre of development and urbanism, the societal values, and lifestyle tend to be dynamic and diverse to respond to the developmental transformations brought by progress and updated legislations. Al- Wardi believes that Iraqi people still live by and under these two counteractive social systems; hadara and badawa, explaining the inverse relationship between statism and Bedouin standards:

In some socio-historical moments of Iraqi history, Bedouin values dominate the social scene, and in others they retreat, mainly depending on whether the state is strong and effective or not. The state is a face of modernity and civilization. Once the state is central, it can easily subdue internal conflicts and enforce security, thus, the industrial, and agricultural sectors will evolve, and urban cities develop accordingly [...] The Bedouin values wane, and are replaced by civilised manifestations based on docility and professionalism. But Iraqi history also witnessed times when the state was so vulnerable that it failed to protect people and belonging. Correspondingly, people start embracing the Bedouin and tribal codes as they offer some order as long as the state is weak. (1965:13)  

For Al-Wardi, the rise of traditional authorities, exemplified by the tribal and sectarian entities,  means decentralisation of the state. The absence of a strong state means the vacuum of law and sovereignty, thus, the rise of Bedouin asabiyah to which Al-Wardi attributed the struggle to establish a democratic political system in Iraq, and the development of an Iraqi cohesive identity (Khouri 2018:97). Having this backdrop in mind, Al-Wardi’s conclusion identified the المد و الجزر of tribalism and confessionalism as a perpetuating phenomenon in Iraq, positioning the state as the only legitimate sovereign that is able to supersede communal affinities and redirect them to unified and cohesive statal citizenship.

In Application:

Al-Wardi’s conclusion 60 years ago is still relevant to the recent political crisis in Iraq. Several Iraqi activists, journalists and political analysts started to use the term Al-Ladaula in reference to the Iraqi state despite the fact that Iraqi successive governments post 2003 came through a democratic process based on national elections, granting the quota systems for minority groups, and women. However, acknowledging Iraqi plurality came through constitutionalising  

 communal divisions, thus, institutionalising ethno-confessional identities. This divisive system rapidly politicised sub-identities- ethnic and sectarian, shifting the centrality of the state into multiple fragmented centres of political parties who are supported by armed tribal and confessional forces. The contemporary Iraqi state is a  hybrid state, or a decentralised state, that exists by the patronage of tribal bodies and sectarian institutions. Neo-tribalism has been institutionalised and weaponized by the state itself to maintain its existence, creating a cyclical independence between tribal power and the political parties. In 2008, the former PM Nuri Al-Maleki created The Tribal Council (Majlis Al-Isnad) mainly from the Shi’a sect, helping the  emergence of a new social strata -  the  ‘New Shaykhs’. Al-Majlis was created to support Al-Maleki’s government in providing security assistance, and helping to solve social problems. Although tribalization policy is not new to the Iraqi polity, Majlis Al-Isnad was created with new strategies; first, it was located inside urban cities, rather than rural areas, including Baghdad and other city centres of the south provinces; second, it was an exclusionary tactic as it included Shi’a tribes only. The rising force of tribalism not only replaced the statal domestic sovereignty, rather, it restructured the societal order of urban and rural spaces, centralising al-asabiyha to the tribe as the source of law and justice in a fragile country.

An Issue to be aware of 

Several contemporary Iraqi sociologists still go back to Al-Wardi’s hypothesis of المد و الجزر to understand neo-tribalism in Iraq post 2003, claiming that his views about the rise of tribalism proved valid in the Iraqi context. It is still important to highlight that we do not know how Al-Wardi would interpret the Iraqi neo-sheikh's phenomenon today in relation to the regional influence and international intervention. Having in mind that Al-Wardi was an advocate of secularity and democracy, what would be his sociological understanding of Iraqi society under the influence of identity crisis and existential struggle among sectarian, political, and ethnic powers. One of the significant differences that took place in reviving the traditional authority of the tribe post 2003 was that this power no longer functions in peripheries while the central state controls city centres. Rather, sheikhs of tribes, sunni and shiá, are mostly orchestrating life in urban cities, existing on the circular narrative of state’s vacuum, and the institutionalisation of identity fragmentation. 

Al-Wardi’s social theory of المد و الجزر revived itself in the 21st century in Iraq, raising many questions about the perpetuity of badawa-hadara conflict that maintains its existence from politicising the multiplicity of the Iraqi national identity rather than absorbing it and reducing its relevance to the public good.`,

      description: `Adnan Ibrahim was born and brought up in a refugee camp in Gaza/Palestine, later moving to Yugoslavia and studying medicine in Sarajevo. In the 1990s he moved to Vienna because of the Third Balkan War, where he became Imam of the Shura mosque in Leopoldstadt in 2002. He holds Austrian citizenship. He speaks Arabic, English, German and Serbo-Croatian.

He is known for shedding new light on some old matters in Islam and analysing them in controversial methods usually using logic and philosophy. His preaching in Arabic reaches a wide audience through digital media.

According to Raphael Israeli, “After the London bombings in 2005, he issued a fatwa saying Muslims who hear of plans for a terrorist attack must report them to the police immediately.” He is also known for having preached and lectured against female genital mutilation.

Evolution
Adnan Ibrahim has produced an entire video series in Arabic that introduces the theory of evolution and reconciles it with Islamic scripture through the use of a traditional Islamic framework. Episode one of which has already been translated into English.

Eschatology
Adnan Ibrahim holds a number of nonconformist views when it comes to the final events of history. He has pointed out a number of inconsistencies and contradictions that exist within the secondary sources (namely the Hadith literature) used to support concepts such as the Dajjal, Mahdi and the return of Christ. In one of his lectures, held in 2012, Adnan Ibrahim argues that the descriptions of the Dajjal, as told in a number of hadiths, are all contradictory and therefore cannot possibly be true, and that the concept of Dajjal contradicts the Qur’an.

Companions
A number of Salafi clerics such as Uthman al-Khamis have criticised Adnan Ibrahim for his views on some of the Prophet’s companions. Most notably, he has produced a series on Muawiyah consisting of 27 episodes that contain criticism of Muawiyah – it discusses Muawiyah’s hate for Ali, the battle of Siffin, bribery, being cursed by the Prophet, and more.

Abrogation
Adnan Ibrahim does not believe that any verses of the Qur’an have been abrogated. Instead, he maintains the view that the verses regarding abrogation refer only to previous scriptures (i.e. the Bible).

Stoning
Adnan Ibrahim rejects the punishment of stoning for adultery. He argues, through the use of a traditional Islamic framework, that the hadiths on stoning cannot possibly take precedence over the Qur’an. This is because the hadiths on stoning are all solitary narrations (ahad), and according to the Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence (usul ul-fiqh), a narration must reach the level of tawatur (a tradition that is mass-transmitted) in order for it to abrogate a verse of the Qur’an. Ibrahim argues that Surat an-Nur, a chapter of the Quran (one of the last Suras to be revealed) doesn’t mention stoning as a punishment. While all the Hadiths which mention stoning are shown to have been said before this Sura was revealed. Moreover, they also seem to be based on the laws of the previous religions (i.e. Judaism and Christianity) prior to the completion of Islamic laws having been revealed. A similar opinion to this has been offered by other influential scholars such as Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi while declined by others.

Controversy
In 2007 Austrian media described him as a controversial figure: liberal in theology and opposing terrorism in Europe, his preaching on Middle Eastern politics has praised anti-Israeli militants and led to accusations of supporting Hamas against Israel. Known as an “enlightened and reforming imam, particularly with regard to women’s issues”, in 2014 he again reportedly preached in support of Hamas, although the accuracy of the translation was called into question

During a speech at the Strasbourg Islamic center, a video of which was posted on the internet in January 2011 (as translated by MEMRI), Ibrahim claimed that Nicolaus Copernicus had actually stolen ideas from the Arab Islamic astronomer Abu Al-Hasan Ibn Al-Shatir. He is not the only writer or speaker to suggest this. He also claimed that other western scientists, including Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Leonardo da Vinci were actually “thieves…who robbed the Islamic heritage, which was kept in the darkness of church crypts for over 200 years.” Ibrahim claimed these comments were made by “a Polish prime minister” when, on a visit to Syria, supposedly admitted all of this to then president Hafez al-Assad that all of these scientists had stolen knowledge from Islamic scholars. Ibrahim also claimed that Muslim scientist Baha Al-Amili had developed a formula for “perpetual energy” and created lighting in a mosque in the city of Isfahan that burned indefinitely without any energy source.`,
